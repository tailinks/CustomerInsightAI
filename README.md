Project Description:
CustomerInsightAI is a comprehensive data science project aimed at analyzing e-commerce customer behavior. Utilizing the Kaggle dataset, this project applies machine learning and data analysis techniques to uncover insights into customer purchasing patterns, preferences, and segmentation. Key components include exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, predictive modeling for customer lifetime value (CLV), and personalized product recommendations. This project is not only a testament to technical prowess in data science but also showcases an understanding of applying data-driven strategies in e-commerce.

Project Implementation:
Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
First, we'll load the dataset and perform an initial EDA to understand its structure and contents. This involves checking for missing values, understanding data types, and getting a feel for the data distribution.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Based on the EDA, we'll preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or standardizing numerical features if necessary.

Step 3: Customer Segmentation
We'll apply clustering techniques (like K-Means) to segment customers. This will help identify different types of customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Step 4: Predictive Modeling
Develop predictive models to estimate customer lifetime value or predict future purchasing behavior. Techniques like regression, decision trees, or random forests can be employed here.

Step 5: Personalized Recommendation System
Implement a recommendation system to suggest products based on past purchasing history. This could use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering methods.
